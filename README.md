# Low-Bit Classification Training System

## Introduction

lowbit classification training is depveloped for effective quantization training.

### Design pattern

+ Backbone, Loss, Quantization .....(TODO)

### Backbone
- [x] ResNet
- [x] ResNeXt
- [x] VGG
- [x] HRNet
- [x] RegNet
- [x] Res2Net

### Quantization
- [x] [DSQ]()
- [x] [LSQ]()
- [x] [LSQ+]()

## Installation
Please refer to [install.md](docs/install.md) for installation and dataset preparation.
